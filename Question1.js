// Given an input array of integers nums, find an integer array, letâ€™s call it differenceArray, of the same length as an input integer array.
// Each element of differenceArray, i.e., differenceArray[i], should be calculated as follows: take the sum of all elements to the left of index i in array nums (denoted as leftSum[i]), and subtract it from the sum of all elements to the right of index i in array nums (denoted as rightSum[i]), taking the absolute value of the result. Formally:
// differenceArray[i] = | leftSum[i] - rightSum[i] |
// If there are no elements to the left/right of i, the corresponding sum should be taken as 0.


const arr = [2, 5, 1, 6];

let sumCountElemt = (arr) =>{
    let leftOfSum = 0;
    let rightOfSum = 0;
    let arr2 = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <arr.length; i++) {
        // console.log(arr[i]);
        let currentElem = arr[i];
        for (let j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
                console.log(arr[j]);
        }


    }
